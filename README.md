# Hi There! I'm Ian!

<!-- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peterthehan/peterthehan/master/assets/linkedin.svg" width="20px" alt="LinkedIn"> -->

I'm a results driven Full Stack Developer with experience using frontend and backend technologies. I thrive when challenged to problem solve with management, teams and in critical situations. I'm passionate about creating applications that integrate functionality with aesthetics to seamlessly enhance my users' UI/UX experience. As a visual learner, I'm excited about front-end development because it allows me to express my problem-solving skills through creative logic and build solutions that visualize my thought process.
